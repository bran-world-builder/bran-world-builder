<h1>Hi, I'm Bran! </h1>

Currently, much of my focus is going into a collaborative gaming project known as Project Apocalypse Farm. This project is built using the Unity platform and is blending of a few of my favorite game genres and mechanics involving farming, life sim, RPG, dungeon crawling, and lots of lore. The game starts deep in a Haven, an automated sanctuary that oversees the long term storage of embryos and ultimately the restoration of humanity. This Haven is run by an artificial intelligence that acts as a foster guardian, teacher, and guide. As the player soon learns, the outside world holds more unknown secrets than they could imagine within the confines of their isolated sanctuary. Venturing to the outside world opens up new possibilities and sparks the dream to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction and rebuild civilization.

Images to come!

## 👋 Hi, I'm Bran – Game Developer & Worldbuilder

I'm a game developer with a background in computer science and a passion for building atmospheric, narrative-rich worlds. My work blends gameplay systems, technical artistry, and storytelling to create immersive, living experiences.

I specialize in Unity (C#), OpenGL, and shader programming, with a growing body of work in UI/UX, world simulation systems, and interactive storytelling. I especially love collaborating in small teams where every voice matters and creativity thrives.

As someone who worked full-time while completing my CS degree, I focused on building a few deep, original projects where I had the time and ability to direct that energy. This allowed me to develop real-world skills in systems design, teamwork, and creative direction; All things that I bring into every project I take on.

Outside of code, I’m an illustrator and worldbuilder, often creating lore, maps, and concepts for games and D&D campaigns. My current focus is completing a narrative-driven farming game built in Unity — a project aimed for release on Steam.
