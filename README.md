<h1>Hi, I'm Bran! </h1>

Currently, much of my focus is going into a collaborative gaming project known as Project Apocalypse Farm. This project is built using the Unity platform and is blending of a few of my favorite game genres and mechanics involving farming, life sim, RPG, dungeon crawling, and lots of lore. The game starts deep in a Haven, an automated sanctuary that oversees the long term storage of embryos and ultimately the restoration of humanity. This Haven is run by an artificial intelligence that acts as a foster guardian, teacher, and guide. As the player soon learns, the outside world holds more unknown secrets than they could imagine within the confines of their isolated sanctuary. Venturing to the outside world opens up new possibilities and sparks the dream to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction and rebuild civilization.
